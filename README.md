# Hey! My name is Gabriel Noronha

## About me

### The beginning
I have started programming at the end of 2019, while I was still in High School. I chose python to start because It looked the easiest language to start and build the mindset of what programming is! 

### The transition
Right after I got a certain experience, I had started to get interested in web development and went to research about this world. I studied the basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Didn't take too long for me to get used to these technologies, so I saw was time to take the next step.

### Nowadays
Currently, I am very focused on studying frameworks that should help me build better web applications than I build nowadays. Such technologies as ReactJS, NodeJS, and similars.
